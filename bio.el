;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This is my experimental library of input routines based on buffers.
;; The general contract is that you should check how much data is
;; available in the buffer before attempting to read (or peek) from it.
;; This is intented to support event-based input (ie 'reactor' style),
;; which is the natural way of processing input (from processes or network)
;; in Emacs.
;;
;; TODO naming -- BIO sounds like it involves output too; ehiggs suggested
;; bile (buffer input library for Emacs), following that line of thinking
;; could take me to bike (k = ?)...  search continues
;;
;; TODO tidy
;;
;; TODO this is quite inefficient code, I like the API but the
;; implementation needs some work
