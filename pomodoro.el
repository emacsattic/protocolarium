;;; pomodoro.el --- A simple-minded attempt at time management

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is an attempt to make a tomato-shaped egg timer out of some
;; old parentheses and a growling computer.  See
;; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique for more
;; information.
;;
;; BRIEF DESCRIPTION
;;
;; M-x pomodoro-work -- report that you have started working on a job
;; M-x pomodoro-break -- report that you have stopped working on a job
;; M-x pomodoro-done -- report that you have completed a job
;; M-x pomodoro-later -- create a job for later and get it off the screen
;;
;; SLIGHTLY LONGER
;; 
;; 1. Enter one or more jobs using lines beginning with a star and a
;;    space.  Ore more than one star.  Like org-mode.  I'm not really
;;    sure how well this will work with org-mode yet.
;;
;; 2. Put your cursor on top of any job line, and run M-x
;;    pomodoro-work to indicate that you have started working on that
;;    job.  Your 25 minute pomodoro time box starts now.  Try to avoid
;;    any interruptions during the pomodoro time.  If you manage to
;;    finish the job before the end of the time box, then run M-x
;;    pomodoro-done to record this, and reward yourself somehow.
;;
;; 3. If not done when your time box ends, you will be reminded to
;;    take a break.  You should indicate that you are stopping by
;;    running M-x pomodoro-break.  The break should last 5 minutes,
;;    and can be used to phone people back, follow up on subproblems
;;    discovered during the pomodoro time, make a cup of tea, etc.
;;
;; 4. If you really need to interrupt your pomodoro time before it is
;;    break time, you should indicate this using M-x pomodoro-break,
;;    just as above, but if you do so before the end of the time box,
;;    you will be asked to log a reason for the interruption.  If
;;    possible you should avoid having to do this: instead, register a
;;    job for later by running M-x pomodoro-later and entering a brief
;;    description, such as 'return call to Fred', or 'put out flames'.
