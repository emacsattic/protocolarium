PROTOCOLARIUM

  `Anyone who considers protocol unimportant has never dealt with a
  cat.' -- Robert A. Heinlein

This is my small collection of protocol-related Emacs Lisp code, or at
least the subset of it that is tidy enough for me to put on github
without cringing too much.  It's mostly about network protocols, but
also covers some binary data formats and systems (for example,
zoneinfo support).

I have written most of these libraries because I wanted to learn
something about protocols in a hands-on way or because I wanted
interact with other systems that I was developing in 'real programming
languages' for testing purposes, but it's also kind of fun to find
amusing uses for them in Emacs.  They are toys, not necessarily
complete implementations of the relevant protocols.

I am putting this code on github in the hope that people will find
something in here useful enough to want to fork it and share their
improvements with me!
