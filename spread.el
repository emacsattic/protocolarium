;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This is just a little warm-up exercise in network programming.  See
;; www.spread.org for more information about the Spread Toolkit, and
;; client libraries for C and Java.
;;
;; Here is an example of use:
;;
;;   ;; create a connection, in this case using the global default
;;   ;; connection name because we are being lazy in the REPL, but you
;;   ;; can have multiple connections and you don't need to use the
;;   ;; default connection variable at all; you can set various
;;   ;; options with keyword arguments, see documentation
;;   (setq spread-default-connection (spread-connect :host "foobox"))
;;
;;   ;; send out a message to a a particular group; defaults to the
;;   ;; connection spread-default-connection, but you can provide the
;;   ;; connection explicitly; you can also set various other options
;;   ;; with keyword arguments, see documentation
;;   (spread-multicast "Hi everyone" :group "GROUP42")
;;
;;   ;; register to receive all messages sent to a group; as above, in
;;   ;; this case we are being lazy again and using the default
;;   ;; connection; we are also using the default callback which
;;   ;; simply prints incoming messages out in the *Messages* buffer
;;   ;; and mini-buffer, but you can provide your own callback which
;;   ;; will receive all mesages for groups that you join
;;   (spread-join "NEWS_FLASHES")
;;
;; Please see the Spread Toolkit documentation for the meaning of
;; service types, message types, priority, membership, self-discard,
;; groups and other Spread concepts.
;;
;; TODO - what is MESSAGE-TYPE actually for?
;; TODO - find out about how to support the new Spread 4.x protocol
;; TODO - implement SPREAD-CONNECT-DEFAULT so that you don't have to
;;        use SETQ to create it yourself
;; TODO - a nice WITH- macro for scoped connections
;; TODO - split callback into two callbacks -- one for messages,
;;        one for session/control/network/error events?
